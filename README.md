# MATLAB Image Processing Preliminary Work

This repository includes MATLAB scripts and documentation for various image processing techniques as an introduction to image processing is done including image filtering, edge detection, two-dimensional Fourier transformation, and inverse filtering, etc.
in the course EE433 at Middle East Technical University (METU).

Requirements: MATLAB (recommended version 2020b or newer)
Setup: Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
Open MATLAB, navigate to the project directory, and run the scripts individually to observe the outcomes of different image processing experiments.

## Experiments
### Experiment A
Objective: Understand the frequency components of a constant image using 2D FFT.
### Experiment B
Objective: Analyze the FFT of a delta function.
### Experiment C
Objective: Investigate frequency components due to a horizontal stripe pattern.
### Experiment D
Objective: Examine the effects of vertical stripes on frequency.
### Experiment E
Objective: Applying a lowpass filter to the image at (pard d) to see the smoothing affect of the lowpass filter.
### Experiment F
Objective: Applying a Laplacian filter (highpass filter) to the image to see the edge detection property of the filter. 
### Experiment G
Objective: Applying a gradient filter to see the enhancements on the 45 degree angle.
